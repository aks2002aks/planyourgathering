This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

We utilize a specific versioning system to denote the progress and development stages of this project. Our version numbers follow a structure represented as `V1.X.Y.Z` where each digit stands for a particular aspect:

- `1` (Major Release): Indicates a major change or significant milestone within the project.
- `X` (Development/Production): Reflects the environment, where `0` represents development, and `1` indicates a production or live environment.
- `Y` (Month): Depicts the number of months the project has been in development or live.
- `Z` (Monthly Changes): Specifies the count of changes made in the specific month.

### Example Versioning Interpretation:

- `V1.0.3.5`: This version indicates the following:
  - It's a major release (1) denoting a significant change or milestone.
  - The project is currently in a development environment (0).
  - The project has been running for three months (3).
  - Five changes have been implemented in the current month (5).

### Version History:
- `V1.0.1.8`: Initial project setup and base configuration.
- `V1.1.1.1`: Improved responsiveness for home intro and navigation on various devices.
- `V1.1.2.3`: Implemented new feature components and resolved known bugs.

Refer to the project log or changelog for detailed information about version updates and changes.

For more details on each version, please check the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
